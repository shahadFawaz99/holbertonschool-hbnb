Part 4 - Simple Web Client
In this phase, you’ll be focusing on the front-end development of your application using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6. Your task is to design and implement an interactive user interface that connects with the back-end services you have developed in previous parts of the project.

Objectives
Develop a user-friendly interface following provided design specifications.
Implement client-side functionality to interact with the back-end API.
Ensure secure and efficient data handling using JavaScript.
Apply modern web development practices to create a dynamic web application.
Learning Goals
Understand and apply HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6 in a real-world project.
Learn to interact with back-end services using AJAX/Fetch API.
Implement authentication mechanisms and manage user sessions.
Use client-side scripting to enhance user experience without page reloads.
Tasks Breakdown
Design (Task 1)

Complete provided HTML and CSS files to match the given design specifications.
Create pages for Login, List of Places, Place Details, and Add Review.
Login (Task 2)

Implement login functionality using the back-end API.
Store the JWT token returned by the API in a cookie for session management.
List of Places (Task 3)

Implement the main page to display a list of all places.
Fetch places data from the API and implement client-side filtering based on country selection.
Ensure the page redirects to the login page if the user is not authenticated.
Place Details (Task 4)

Implement the detailed view of a place.
Fetch place details from the API using the place ID.
Provide access to the add review form if the user is authenticated.
Add Review (Task 5)

Implement the form to add a review for a place.
Ensure the form is accessible only to authenticated users, redirecting others to the index page.
When testing your client against yout API you’ll probably get a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) error. You’ll need to modify your API code to allow your client to fetch data from the API. Read this article for a depper understanding about CORS and how to configure your Flask API
